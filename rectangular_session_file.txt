# state design parameter names and their corresponding value ranges by alternating between them
# to state a value range, either state each value individually and without blank spaces: <value 1>, <value_2>,<value_3>,<value_4>
# or State a lower and upper bound and a step size to define the value range as a closed intervall: <lower_bound> <upper_bound> <step_size>
